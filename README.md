# Pitman Training HTML and CSS Course Project

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Pitman Training HTML and CSS Course Project repository! My name's Tom, and I'm super excited to embark on this journey of learning web development with you.
## About This Project

In this repository, you'll find all the files and resources related to the projects I'll be working on as part of the Pitman Training HTML and CSS course. This course aims to teach us the fundamentals of building web pages using HTML and styling them with CSS. As a beginner, I'll be learning step-by-step how to create attractive and interactive web pages.
## Course Goals

The primary objectives of this course project are:

- Learning HTML
: Understand the building blocks of web development by mastering HTML tags, elements, and their proper usage.

- Mastering CSS
: Get a grip on Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to add design, layout, and interactivity to web pages.

- Creating Real Projects
: Apply the knowledge gained from the course to create real-world web projects.

- Gaining Confidence
: Gain confidence in writing HTML and CSS code by practicing and experimenting with various concepts.
